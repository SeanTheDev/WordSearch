You'll generally read and write longer paragraphs in academic papers. However, too many long
paragraphs can provide readers with too much information to manage at one time. Readers 
need planned pauses or breaks when reading long complex papers in order to understand your presented
ideas. Remember this writing mantra: "Give your readers a break!" or
"Good paragraphs give one pause".
